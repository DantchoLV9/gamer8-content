Recently completed Metro 2033 & Metro: Last Light. I was gonna write the review of Metro 2033 before playing Last Light, but I just couldn't wait.

So how good is Metro 2033?

Well, there is nothing to say about the graphics. The game is quite old and it shows. Not so much while underground in my opinion, but definitely when you go to the surface. Overall the graphics are fine and if you wanted to play through the whole series, but didn't know if the graphics will be too bad by today's standards, then you don't have to worry.

The gameplay was good. Shooting, collecting ammo, navigating through the Metro 2033 world. Fun, simple, and easy as long as you're not aiming to get the good ending. I'll explain what I mean in a bit. I also want to mention some things about the weapons in the game. I really like the weapon customization options and the weapons themselves.

The story was very interesting. It's the thing that made me play Last Light before writing this review. I'm not going to comment on any details of the story as I don't like spoilers, but there is one thing that's worth knowing.

The game had two endings. One of them is considered bad and the other good. I received the bad ending, but I was happy with it since it was the one that the second game Metro: Last Light continues from. The thing is that the game doesn't make it clear how to get the good or the bad ending. That's fine maybe it's a dialogue choice or maybe killing someone or choosing to spare them?

Well not really.

Metro 2033 uses some kind of point system which in the end determines your ending. From what I've seen it's gonna be a nightmare to get the good ending. It's probably not hard to do, but it just changes how the game feels. Instead of following the story, you'll be focusing on the hundreds of things that you need to do for the good ending. That's the only big issue I have with this game.

Overall the story and the gameplay are very good while the graphics are a bit outdated, but still pretty good.

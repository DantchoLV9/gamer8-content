Okay, let's see...

BeamNG.drive is definitely one of the best car games I've played. There are so many things that make it great it would be hard to talk about them all, but I'll try.

I'll start with the obvious. The crash physics. It's so fun just crashing cars in a game with such realism. I don't know why, but I'm sure that 99% of people will agree with me.

And it's not only the crashing and bending of metal. Different parts of the engine, drivetrain, and suspension can get damaged which affects the car in different ways.

Then there is the driving. It feels extremely nice. Especially with a controller which is a big plus for me at least, since I can't always set up my wheel when I want to play it for a bit.

I'd say that normal driving probably feels the best in BeamNG.drive. Racing also feels pretty nice after some of the last updates. Drifting isn't as easy though, since at least for me the game doesn't provide any feedback, so there is no controller vibration which helps for things like that.

And finally, my favourite thing about the game is the car customisation. I love how I can start with a base car and set up the suspension for drifting or rally racing. Or the engine for drag racing or track racing.

There are a lot of options when it comes to customisation and it is so good that I've spent 300 hours at the time of writing this review playing BeamNG.drive. Now, this may not seem like a lot to some people, but considering the game is still under development. It is my second most played game on Steam.

So with all of that said here are some bad things about the game. First of all, it is hard to feel the cars when driving with a controller. Slower driving is pretty easy, but when going faster without any feedback from the controller it can get tricky.

Also not having a story mode done yet makes it a bit boring after playing for a while, but if I'm being honest things like the scenarios are pretty nice and can be played for a long time.

Other things that keep my attention on BeamNG.drive are all the community mods, the updates which provide new features and content, and the Automation - The Car Company Tycoon Game which allows you to build your own cars and drive them in BeamNG.drive.

I recommend this game to everyone that likes cars. People that are not that much into cars may also like it just for messing around. It is definitely a must-play for me.

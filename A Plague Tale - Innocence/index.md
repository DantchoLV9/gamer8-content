This one is going to be a hard review to write.

First of all wow. This game is good. Really good. Definitely one of my favorites.

At the moment of writing this review A Plague Tale: Innocence is my favorite story-rich game. I can't wait for the new one A Plague Tale: Requiem to come out in 2022.

So about the game. I'm not going to focus as much on the three rating categories as they all seem perfect to me. Instead, I'm going to speak about why I liked the game so much.

When I started playing it I was surprised by the pace at which the story progressed. It did seem a bit strange at first since I wasn't used to things happening in the first hour of playing. I had just recently played Infra which is the opposite. Taking too long for any progress in the story to happen.

So as I continued playing A Plague Tale: Innocence I actually liked the faster pace at which the story unfolded. The game still felt long, but at no point during my gameplay did I ever feel bored or burned out from the game. Something uncommon for me, since my interest in a game usually disappears quite quickly and I rarely complete a game in one go.

And quickly something about the graphics and gameplay.

The graphics were really good. I mean they are not the best graphics that I've ever seen, but for a non-AAA game, they are really good.

I also liked the gameplay. At no point during my gameplay did I find any part of the gameplay frustrating. Can't say the same for other games like Assassin's Creed.

I won't say anything about the story other than it's really good and it makes the game a must-play.

So, if you happen to have missed A Plague Tale: Innocence maybe consider playing it as it is a beautiful game worth playing.

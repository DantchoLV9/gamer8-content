At first glance, BladeGunners seems like a simple arena shooter with nice graphics. There is however something very interesting about this game. I’m going to talk about that in a bit but first, let's check out the graphics.

Before I say anything about the game I want to point out that the build I played at the time of writing this review wasn’t final, so there may be things that are different in the final build.

There is a nice balance between the assets used which creates a consistent feel making the game feel more professional. The small details like bullet holes and particles are a nice touch as well. This is probably a map-specific thing, but the hologram signs are pretty nice too. (At the moment there is only one map, which is fine since the game is a university project) I did find a couple of holes in the map which looked out of place, so that is something that could be fixed. Also, the menus are a bit inconsistent which is not a huge issue, but it does make the game seem unfinished.

So what was so interesting about BladeGunners? Well, it’s a shooter with a very unique movement system that really changes the way it can be played. The players in BladeGunners slide using plazma skates which allow them to achieve high top speed, perform jumps from ramps and grind on rails. All of these actions are not only cool but are also useful during gameplay as they allow players to evade enemies, charge their guns (by sliding on rails), and flow smoothly through the map which can be very satisfying when done properly after a bit of training.

Overall I think the game has incredibly addicting gameplay and stunning visuals. You can check it out [here](https://mediocrereality.itch.io/bladegunners).

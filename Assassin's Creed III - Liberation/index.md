### Review

I played Assassin's Creed III: Liberation after playing Assassin's Creed III. Overall I thought that it wasn't as good as Assassin's Creed III.

I focused on the main story which I didn't really find interesting. I also felt that it was quite short, so I wasn't really impressed by the story of the game.

In terms of the graphics there isn't anything worth mentioning in my opinion. Not the worst graphics and definitely not the best.

There were some missions which I actually quite liked though. Overall the gameplay of Assassin's Creed III: Liberation felt different compared to the games from the series which wasn't a bad thing. It just wasn't anything special.

I wouldn't recommend Assassin's Creed III: Liberation to most people. I think it's only worth playing if you are a huge fan of the series and maybe wanted to play all the Assassin's Creed games.

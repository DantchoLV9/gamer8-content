Car Mechanic Simulator 2018 is a good game providing semi realistic simulation of a car mechanic's job. Other games like MySymmerCar and maybe Wrench do a better job in my opinion.

Car Mechanic Simulator 2018 is a good game providing semi realistic simulation of a car mechanic's job. Other games like MySymmerCar and maybe Wrench do a better job in my opinion.

As for the gameplay, well its good, but it gets repetitive so quickly you'll probably still have time to refund the game in Steam.

Its a good game, but it doesn't really appeal to someone like me who is too much into cars. Almost all the cars in the game feel the same. Even though there are a couple of different engine variants all of them feel too similar, and once you've worked on one type of engine you know how to work on all of them.

MySummerCar on the other hand offers only a single engine. A very simple inline 4, but it's a lot harder to put together or take apart. Feels like a challenge every time I do it.

Driving in Car Mechanic Simulator also feels awful. Something that is again done a lot better in MySummerCar.

Overall I would not recommend Car Mechanic Simulator. In my opinion MySummerCar is a lot more fun, but it is also a different type of game, so I can't just say that it's the better game of the two. I would definitely play it again though. Something I can't say about Car Mechanic Simulator.

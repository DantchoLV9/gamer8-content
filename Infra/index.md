Okay, so where do I begin with this game. I was really excited to play Infra, but I will admit that at one point of the game it started feeling a bit dull.

The game consists of 10 chapters with each chapter having different maps. For me the first couple of chapters were really interesting. I really enjoyed chapters 1 through 5. The maps felt quite different, and since the game was still pretty new for me, it was quite interesting to look around and figure out the puzzles. I'd say that the fifth chapter was the first chapter that was a lot harder and required me to look for some help from the internet.

Chapters 6 through 8 were quite hard and as far as I remember didn't have much change of scenery. I did use a lot of help for these chapters as some of them had map which were quite big and some of the puzzles were hard to figure out.

The last two chapters were more interesting although the beginning of chapter 9 was definitely a bit weird. Chapter 10 was really good since it introduced some new challenges that weren't too hard to figure out, but were also really interesting.

Throughout the whole game I collected evidence which was related to the story of the game. I will admit that I didn't pay as much attention to the whole story of the game, but I will say that I'm glad that it was there and that it did make the game a lot better.

As for the graphics of the game. They are definitely not the best, but due the the nature of the game, the graphics felt sufficient and during my gameplay of the game I didn't notice any bad map spots or graphical elements that were badly made.

The gameplay is pretty simple, since the game mainly relies on logic and puzzles to challenge the player. The player is however required to take photographs of damaged structures, etc. This has now caused me to try taking a pictures of cracks in the walls of buildings in other games as well. Oh well.

So, is the game worth it. I would say that it depends. At the moment of writing this review I can't say if I'm really into puzzle games, but I can say that I definitely didn't play this game for the puzzles. I played it for the exploration of abandoned buildings and for my interest in dams.

With that in mind I'd say the first couple of chapters were really fun for me, but as I said in the beginning of the review at about the mid point of the game it becomes dull and only gets better toward the end. If you like the theme of the game, and you are a fan of puzzle games then it may be for you. If that's not you then you may lose interest during one of the middle chapters.
